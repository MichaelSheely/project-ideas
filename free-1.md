# Free project 1

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

This project is designed to serve individuals who need to schedule meetings
among a large group.

Currently the de-facto standards for scheduling are one
of the following two methods:
 * Everyone send out their availability for a certain time and a leader
picks the times that seem to work best for a plurality.
 * Everyone uses some software, such as a WhenIsGood&#8482; or WhenToMeet&#8482;
and choses a binary yes/no for each time slot.

If I was able to help them, users would be able to specify, in a way that feels
natural, their availability and preferences.  Hopefully this can reduce either
the work of an individual (who must compile the results of an email) or the
repetition inherent in painting over the same boxes for pairs of weeks when
using a WhenIsGood&#8482;.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

Since a large part of scheduling involves individuals
expressing their constraints (and hopefully preferences as well), a language
might be a good fit, since it can be tailored to allow this expressiveness
in a way that a simple calendar might not.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
